# CACIMAR: cross-species analysis of cell identities, markers and regulations using single-cell sequencing profiles

CACIMAR has the following 4 main functions:

* **Identify all cell-type specific markers in each species**

* **Identify species-specific or evolutionally conserved markers**

* **Identify conserved intracellular regulations (gene regulatory networks)**

* **Identify conserved intercellular interactions (cell-cell communications)**
