\arguments{
\item{MGI}{MGI database, download from http://www.informatics.jax.org/}

\item{Species_name1}{The name of the first species. input 'mm' for mouse, 'hs'
for human, 'zf' for zebrafish, 'ch' for chicken, 'cf' for dog, 'pt' for chimpanzee,
'xt' for frog, 'rn' for rat, 'bt' for cattle, and 'rh' for macaque.}

\item{Species_name2}{The name of the second species.  input 'mm' for mouse, 'hs'
for human, 'zf' for zebrafish, 'ch' for chicken, 'cf' for dog, 'pt' for chimpanzee,
'xt' for frog, 'rn' for rat, 'bt' for cattle, and 'rh' for macaque.}

\value{
homologous gene database of two species
}
\description{
Build homologous gene database according to Vertebrate Homology
data in MGI database. This function currently supports ten species: cattle,
chicken, chimpanzee, dog, frog, human, macaque, mouse, rat, and zebrafish. After
building the database, this function also integrates biomaRt to add ENSEMBEL ID
for each gene in the database.
