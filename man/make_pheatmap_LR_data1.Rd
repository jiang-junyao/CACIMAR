)
}
\arguments{
\item{cci_conserved_results}{dataframe, the result from function Identify_Conserved_CCI2}

\item{seurat_object_sp1}{seurat object of species1}

\item{seurat_object_sp2}{seurat object of species2}

\item{species_name1}{character, two character the representation the species1, like "mm"}

\item{species_name2}{character, two character the representation the species2, like "zf"}

\item{avg_group}{character, which group used to calculate the average expression, like "celltype" in metadata}

\item{cci_conserved_Weights}{dataframe, the result from function Caculate_cell_pair_cci_score}

\item{subset_quantile}{numeric, the value to filter the conserved score of the cell-cell interaction, default is 0.75 of the consered score of cell-cell interaction}

\item{assay_set}{which assay used for average expression, like "RNA", or "SCT"}
}
\value{
list, contains the dataframe for heatmap, and the average expression for each species
